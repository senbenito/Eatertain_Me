Cauliflower, tomatoes, onions and cucumber round out this flavor fest.Do you ever feel late to the party?The appropriate hashtag that I need to use when someone asks me that is: #SOMLIm the person that makes vegan banana ice cream with cookie dough, liiiiiike, 2 years after it is totally cool and trendy. I am also the girl who decides to FINALLY try making paleo pecan pie bars because, in her 26 years of walking this planet will call earth, she has NEVER tried pecan pie.LIIIIKE WHAT? I cant keep up.This is exactly what happened with this Sheet Pan Whole30 Cashew Curry Chicken.You probably caught the sheet pan dinner bug WAYYYYYYY back in the fall last year when Pinterest started blowing up your feed with delicious dinner creations like one pan honey roasted turkey and vegetables and one pan roasted chicken and vegetables for two",

Even if youre getting tired of easy dinners that only take one pan (and, if you are, WHO ARE YOU?!) you MUSTMUSTMUST devour this mish-mash of spicy, tender roasty vegetables that sit under a bed of JUICY-on-the-inside and MEGA crispy-crunchy-curry-chicken YUM on the outside.Not to mention its approved for all you SUPER BRAVE January whole30 goers. SRSLY, major round of applause to you.I like testing the boundaries of just how healthy I can eat and all, but there is nothing that can part me from starting my day with chocolate overnight oats.You first got introduced to my idea of crusting chicken in nuts, instead of things like flour, back when we munched on pistachio crusted chicken.whiiiiich I have basically been dreaming about forever and ever because WHY DO NUTS MAKE EVERYTHING SO MUCH MORE DELICIOUS.Which is where the idea of cashew-crusted chicken came bursting inside my little recipe-creating brain. OBVI with curry. If the pumpkin quinoa curry, Thai curry cashews and sweet potato coconut curry didnt tip you off that spicy-dinner-lovin is what my belly craves, then I wonder about the thinking status of your brain.Anyway.The roasty-toasty nutty flavor of the spiced-cashew-chicken-hug, in combination with notes of coconut-covered soft vegetables that youre about to put in your mouth, is basically EVERYTHING that you THINK your easy-delicious-dinner-loving-inner-soul could want.Spicy mega flavor? CHECK. Saucy goodness from bursts of juicy cooked tomato? OH YES. Texture overload happening inside your food-munchin face? MOST DEFINITELY.Just when youre going to declare that this is the best STUPID-EASY weeknight chicken dinner that your healthy-food lovin self has ever had the happiness of eating, the SUPER REFRESHING cucumber hits you RIGHT THERE.It balances alllll the warm curry feels that are happening inside your tummy in way that can only be described as the most perfect marriage of food EVER.Cucumber may not be the most traditional addition to Indian food, but if its good? ITS GOOD.I have a question for you?Where are my super-busy-after-work dont-have-time-to-cook-but-so-HANGRY humans at?This one goes out to you.Print",
