When the oil is hot (but not smoking or splattering), fry the coated breasts in single-layer batches until they are golden brown on both sides. If your oil is at the right temperature, it should take about 3-4 minutes per side. Don’t fry more than two breasts at a time in a regular sized skillet, or the oil temperature will drop and the schnitzels will become greasy.After frying, set the schnitzels on a wire rack or a paper towel to drain off excess oil.

We usually cut them about a centimeter wide, but you can cut them thicker or thinner depending on your personal preference.Scoop up the noodles and scatter them on a piece of parchment paper to finish drying.Once you have cut the noodles, you can immediately proceed with making the chicken and noodles. If you’d rather store the noodles for future use, let them dry completely (this can take 24-48 hours depending on the weather). Once the noodles are totally dry, place them in an airtight container or Ziploc bag and store them in a dark, cool place. They will last about 1 month; discard them if they start to darken or turn black.Note: The chicken stock can actually be made while the noodles are drying, if you’re running short on time. My mom prefers to make the chicken stock after the noodles are cut, because the process is more fun when you have stretches of time to sit around and chat while things are cooking. Rinse your whole chicken (giblets removed) and place it into a large stockpot. Cover the chicken with water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes.
